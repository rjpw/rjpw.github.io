I recently completed a Master's in Computer Science from Carleton University, following a late undergraduate Bachelor's Degree in Comp-Sci with a Minor in Psychology. I'm interested the usability and security challenges of modern web development and hosting.

## Current Status

I am currently wrapping up a volunteer project overhauling the [Canadian Naval Technical History Association](http://www.cntha.ca/) website and its underlying infrastructure with the goal of improving its usability, stability, security, and performance. The tech stack includes LXC, Ansible, NSQ, and Gitlab. I will be writing about the lessons learned in the weeks to come.
